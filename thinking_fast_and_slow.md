# Thinking, Fast and Slow

## Part 1

* the two systems
	* **system 1** - operates automatically and quickly, with no effort and no sense of voluntary control
	* **system 2** - allocates attention to the effortful mental activities
* "pay attention" - there is a limited budget of attention available
* intense focusing on a task can make people blind (the invisible gorilla)
* the division of labor between the two systems is highly efficient - minimizes effort and optimizes for perf
* system 1 has systematic errors, called biases
* the pupils of the eye **dilate** instantly when system 2 engages in effort
	* also the heart rate is increased
	* you could learn when someone stopped working on a task just by seeing when his pupils contract
* when walking comfortably, ask a friend to compute 23 x 78. He will certainly stop
* **the flow** = a state of effortless concentration so deep that you lose the sense of time
* system 2 can be depleted by effort. To replenish it, use **glucose**
* system 2 can accept wrong answers from system 1, because he is **lazy**
* Stanovich (the guy who invented system 1/2) thinks that rationality, different from intelligence, is  the ability to be immune to biases
* principles of association of things: resemblance, contiguity in time/space, causality
* **priming**/activation - given you read about being old and things like that, you will walk slowly, w/out any awareness (Florida/ideomotor effect)
	* if polling stations are in a school, then you are more likely to support school initiatives
* the Lady Macbeth effect - if you are primed to kill someone, you will want to clean your body
* **cognitive ease** - system 1 controls, and you believe what you hear, trust your intuitions, …
* **cognitive strain** - system 2 controls, you are vigilant, invest more effort
* illusions of remembering (familiarity), illusions of truth (frequent repetition)
* persuasive message - maximise contrast between letters and background, use bold, bright blue or red, use simple language, rhymes
* Cognitive Reflection Test - problems w/ immediate answer that is false
* system 1 is in charge of **assessing normality**
	* if you see on the road, in someplace a car catching fire, and you see in another day another car; then you will think normally that cars catch fire in that place
* the **Moses illusion** - how many animals did Moses take into the ark?
	* it was Noah, not Moses
	* but the biblical context makes the 2 names possible
* our inborn readiness to separate physical and intentional causality explains the near **universality of religious beliefs**
	* we perceive the world of objects as separate from the world of minds
* when system 2 is engaged, we will believe almost everything
* the **halo effect** is the tendency to like (or dislike) everything about a person, including not observed things, based solely on one a few traits
	* you can grade a test, see that the first essay was very good, then think that the mistakes in the next ones are not so important
* **decor-relate error** - imagine a group of people have to estimate the number of pennies in a jar. Individuals do very poorly, but averaging the results tends to be quite accurate
* **what you see is all that is** - system 1 can only make connections between primed ideas
	* in combination with a lazy system 2, means the brain will endorse many intuitive beliefs
	* overconfidence, framing effects, base-rate neglect
* people judge competence in faces by combining strength and trustworthiness (judgement heuristic)
* **mental shotgun** - system 1 cannot carry one just the computations system 2 requires
	* he was asked if the company was financially sound, but he couldn’t forget that he likes the product
* if a satisfactory answer is not found quickly for a complex matter, system 1 will substitute the question to one easier
* **affect heuristic** - people let their likes and dislikes determine their beliefs about the world

## Part 2 - heuristics and biases

* **extreme** outcomes are likely to be found in **small** samples
	* the incidence of cancer in rural area is not lower or higher, it just appears so
* system 1 is biased to believe results, only system 2 can have doubt
* because system 1 seeks causation, we try to see **patterns** in **random** events
	* **hot hands** in basketball do not exist
	* we classify random events as systematic, rejecting that life is random
	* a study said that students in schools that are smaller than average tend to do the best. But students in these type of schools tend to also do the worst.
	* jumping to conclusions is a safer sport in the world of our imagination than it is in reality
* **anchoring effect** - people consider a particular value for an unknown quantity before estimating that quantity
	* start from an anchoring number and adjust if it is too high or too low, by moving the anchor. Typically, the adjustment ends **prematurely**. 
	* insufficient adjustment is a failure of a week or lazy system 2
	* suggestion is also a priming effect, because system 1 tries to construct a world where the anchor is true
	* the typical value for anchoring is 55%
	* professionals are also susceptible to anchoring effects. Retail agents were wrong by 41%. The difference is pros **do not think** that they are affected by anchors.
	* moving first is an **advantage** in single-issue negotiations
	* if you think the other side has made an outrageous proposal, do not come back with another outrageous counter-offer. Male a scene and storm out. To defend from the anchoring effects, think the opposite, about the minimal offer the opponent would accept or the cost of failing to reach an agreement.
	* whatever number is in front of us, it affects us and we should mobilize system 2 to combat the effect
* **availability heuristic** - you wish to estimate the size of a category or the frequency of an event, but you substitute and report an impression of the ease which you recall something
	* **availability cascade** - self-sustaining chain of events, which starts from a minor event and leads to public panic
* **base rate neglect** - you think more about the representatives of an event using system 1, but fail to use the statistic facts. You substitute a judgement of representatives for the probability.
* in **joint probability**, less is more. System 1 averages instead of adding
* Causes and Statistics
  * No need to worry about this statistical information being ignored. On the contrary, it will immediately be used to feed a stereotype.
* **regression to the mean** - the results will always tend to go to the average. High outliers will perform poorly, and low outliers will perform better. Correlation vs causation.
	* our mind is strongly biased toward causal explanations and cannot deal with statistics
* the evaluation of the future is the same as the evaluation of the present (substitution)
* How to do regression to the mean:
	*	get to the baseline
	*	get the intuitive prediction
	* estimate the correlation between evidence and the target
	*	move from the baseline to the prediction, based on the correlation
* if you are a VC, you may not want to use this method, because you want to find black swans

## Part 3 - Overconfidence

* **narrative fallacy** the tendency of believe flawed stories of the past because we want to make sense of the world
* once you adopt a new view of the world, you immediately lose much of your ability to recall what you used to believe before your mind changed
* **hindsight bias** - the “I-knew-it-all-along” effect
* **outcome bias** - if the outcome is bad, then we blame. If it is good, then we praise.
	* this favors the reckless, the gambles, the few and transforms them in _leaders_
* the **illusion of validity** - even though you know your work is useless, you still cannot embody this information
	* the illusion of skill of stock traders is an example
	* traders appear to be ignorant of their ignorance
* simple formulas where each feature has the same weight are as better as complex ones found from linear regression
* there is a hostility towards algorithms in taking decisions (medical situations), but formulas are better then people
* intuition adds value, but only after a disciplined collection of objective information
