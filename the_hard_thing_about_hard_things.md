	* admit reality
	* try to make him stay
* lies that losers tell
	* people that quit, but it’s okay because we would want to fire them
	* we could not sell as cheap as our competitors
	* we missed intermediate milestone, but we’ll ship on schedule
	* we get a high churn rate, but email marketing should help us
* lead bullets - there are no silver bullets, you must improve the core product
* nobody cares, just coach the company
* take care of the people, the product, the profits
* a good place to work is where people know that their work will be efficient, effective and make a difference for the organization
	* people focus on their work and trust the organization
	* in a bad organization, people fight politics and broken processes
	* being a good company does not matter when things go right
	* it matters when things go wrong
	* things always go wrong (in a spiral)
* startups should train people
	* productivity
	* performance management
	* product quality
	* employee retention
	* implement a training program
* good/bad project managers
* is it okay to hire people from your friend’s company
	* friends in business are scarce
	* ask the friend for a reference and ask him if he lets the hire to go through
* bring big execs into your company
	* rhythm mismatch - they wait for emails to receive, they are reactive. But things in startups have to be created.
	* skill set mismatch - in a corp you run stuff. In a startup you build stuff.
* hiring execs
	* value their strengths. Hiring by committee will search for lack of weakness.
* employees misinterpret managers
	* don’t focus on details like when the deals are done. Focus on the value of them.
	* metrics will be gamefied
	* managing only by numbers is like painting by numbers. Amateurs do it.
* management debt
	* don’t put two people in leading positions. Even though they complement each other.
	* overcompensating an employee just because he has a bigger offer. Use performance management or employee feedback.
* sometimes the right policy is going by the CEO’s gut. Like keeping profanity language. But state it in a fare manner.
* CEOs create politics indirectly unintentionally

			* promotions
	* be careful at complaints
		* behavior - put the two people in a room
		* competency - decline there exists one, launch an investigation, and find out more
	* the right kind of ambition - put the team in front of yourself
* some smart employees are bad
	* the heretic - every decision or promotion is seen badly
	* the flake - the best, but sometimes lazy
	* the jerk - you may have a Denis Rodman, but only one because else is an anarchy
* bring old people
	* know what you want. If you don’t know what you want, inspire from other companies.
	* performance measure (Bill Campbell)
		* results against objectives
		* management - does he have a loyal and strong team
		* innovation - a CTO may deliver but with a poor architecture
		* working with peers - does he help his peers develop

	* it’s for an employee
	* put him in the center, by sending an email for him to decide on the structured agenda
	* talk only 20%
	* draw conclusions
	* ask open questions, especially to shy people
* programming your culture
	* a culture does not help you achieve market fit
	* it helps you when your company grows and maintain the same values
	* distinguish from your competitors
	* identify employees who fit your mission
		* amazon - desks made out of doors
		* fb - move fast break things

		* how to do it
			* figure out what needs to be communicated - who needs the knowledge
			* what needs to be decided
			* prioritize the most important communication paths
			* decide who’s going to run each group (fourth step, not first)
			* identify what paths go wrong
			* build a plan to solve those
		* processes - the purpose of it is for communication
			* you cannot point-to-point communicate in a 300 people organization
			* processes are like magistral buses
				* focus on the output
				* figure out what you want at each steep (enough candidates, right candidates, interview, etc.)
				* engineer accountability
		* managing at scale is a learned skill, not a natural ability
* most difficult CEO skill - manage psychology
	* you learn to be a CEO by being a CEO
	* two mistakes

		* great CEOs face the pain and don’t quite
* most important skills are brilliance and courage
	* the right choice require intelligence and courage
	* if the leader chooses a path, everybody else will follow. But make that decision.
	* some decisions are really hard, but correct
* ones and twos
	* one type executives - gather information, comprehensive knowledge, get bored with executing
	* twos, enjoy the process of making a company run, they get nervous if they don’t do something
* leaders are made, key three traits
	* ability to articulate the vision - Steve Jobs. Better storytellers.

	* ability to achieve the vision - Andy Grove - just learn it
* peacetime/wartime CEO
	* radically different management styles
* make yourself a CEO
	* this skill is un-natural - you can learn it only by doing it
	* you must be really good at giving feedback
		* the shit sandwich
		* it’s a dialogue, not a monologue
		* high-frequency feedback - give it in every moment
			* feedback won’t be personal
* evaluate CEOs - quantitively approach for the key 3 traits
* freaky friday technique - make people exchange places if they go at war
* don’t sell your company only if
	* your market is bigger then the offer
	* you will be the leader of it
